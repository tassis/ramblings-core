# Maintenance Writing Plans

Write concise implementation plans for **existing projects** (not greenfield speculation).

## Scope

- Use for maintenance work where behavior is already in place.
- **Brief-first by default.** Plan only when implementation-ready, explicitly requested, or explicitly accepted.
- This is a maintenance contract: prioritize safety over novelty in imperfect projects.

## Output artifacts

Primary plan:

```text
.ramblings/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md
```

Optional execution state:

```text
.ramblings/checklists/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.yaml
```

In Conductor Mode these files are planning artifacts under `.ramblings/` and must not be treated as product edits.

## Tag responsibility in planning
- This phase is the main place to record task tags explicitly for downstream execution hints.
- Keep tags few, meaningful, and optional.
- Missing or sparse tags are valid; execution should not depend on them being present.
- Treat task-level `Tags` as the main work-shape routing hints; skill-local wording may help discovery, but the plan is the source of truth for task-level tags.

### Preferred starter tag set

Prefer this shared starter set before inventing new tags.

- **domain:** `coding`, `writing`, `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `docs`, `workflow`
- **process:** `planning`, `implementation`, `refactor`, `migration`, `debug`, `qa`, `handoff`, `archive`
- **risk / posture:** `high-risk`, `verification-heavy`, `bounded`, `multi-step`

If one of these fits, use it instead of inventing a synonym. Add a new tag only when the starter set clearly cannot express the work shape.

## When to use

- Multi-step work
- Multiple files/subsystems touched
- Clear implementation-ready target with concrete files + ordered tasks + verification
- User asks for a plan / allows direct planning / direct landing
- Risk is high enough to require a written execution contract

### Routing

- Explicit request first: follow user direction for handoff (e.g., execute, investigate, or delegate).
- Then `Tags` / `Suggested Capability`: when metadata clearly maps to a specialized lane, route there first.
- Then conservative inference: if work is already sequenced and checklist-ready -> `ramblings-implementing-plans`; if not implementation-ready -> `ramblings-brainstorming`.
- Otherwise keep using this core planning skill as fallback.

Skip for trivial one-file tweaks unless explicitly requested.

## Required contract (do not weaken)

### Plan header (required first block)

Every plan must start with:

```markdown
# [Topic] Maintenance Plan

**Goal:** [one sentence]
**Current Risk:** [what is uncertain or dangerous]
**Approach:** [2-4 sentences]
**Verification Strategy:** [tests, reproduction, manual checks]

---

**Execution State:** `.ramblings/checklists/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.yaml`
```

The checklist is the source of **live execution state**; the plan is planning intent + risk + recommendations.

### Plan body must include

- Exact file paths for read/create/modify.
- Ordered tasks.
- Verification for each risky step.
- Optional explicit task tags in each task block when they help routing.
- Clear “manual when no automation” fallback.
- Completion criteria that are observable.
- Resumption via checklist reference.

### Plan/checklist split (explicit)

- **Plan:** why, risk, steps, recommendation, checks.
- **Checklist:** status, active task, next action, blockers.

## Task template (compact, clear)

```markdown
## Task N: [short name]

**Why:** [why this task exists]

**Tags:** [optional, few, prefer the shared starter set first, e.g. `coding`, `backend`, `migration`]
**Risk:** [low/medium/high; key uncertainty]

**Files:**
- Read: `path/to/file`
- Modify: `path/to/file`
- Create: `path/to/file`
- Verify: `path/to/test-or-command`

**Suggested Capability:** [optional]
**Suggested External Review:** [optional]

**Steps:**
1. [specific action]
2. [specific action]

**Verification:**
- Run: `exact command`
- Expect: [observable result]

**Completion Criteria:**
- [specific done condition]

**Re-entry / Idempotence:**
- [how to detect already complete]

**Notes / Risks:** [short edge case or dependency]
```

## Principle rules (short form)

1. `Tags`, `Risk`, `Suggested Capability`, `Suggested External Review` are soft hints only.
2. Use exact paths and deterministic commands.
3. Keep tasks small, concrete, and ordered.
4. State exactly which tests run; if unavailable, state manual checks explicitly.
5. Do not over-design; this is maintenance planning.
6. Every task is complete only after verification passes and the checklist is updated.

## No-placeholder rule

Forbidden phrases (replace with concrete work):

- TODO
- implement later
- add validation
- handle edge cases
- write tests
- refactor as needed
- similar to previous task

## Maintenance-specific guidance

- Start with behavior understanding when behavior is uncertain.
- Add targeted inspection steps for confusing/risky files.
- Prefer minimal, reversible changes.
- Use the checklist for multi-session resumability.

## Before finishing a plan

Self-check quickly:

1. Do requirements map to tasks?
2. Are all paths concrete?
3. Is verification explicit for risky items?
4. Is automation vs manual verification clear?
5. Can resume be done from checklist without guessing?
