description: Draft-only helper for extension pack authors to shape skill/agent artifacts, routing notes, and optional plugin-side conductor expansion guidance while preserving core ownership and specialized-first/core-fallback behavior.

# Integration Creator

Use this as an authoring helper for creating new `ramblings` extension packs.
It drafts artifacts; it does not run runtime behavior.

## Scope (authoring-only)

- Help authors decide what to specialize and which core phase(s) to hook into.
- Draft an extension `SKILL.md` when requested.
- Draft a single extension agent prompt only when plugin-provided `conductor` expansion is required.
- Draft short optional plugin-side notes for adding one specialist to existing `conductor` dispatch, while keeping it optional and fallback-safe.
- Emit compact routing notes using specialized-first + core-fallback language.
- Emit boundary reminders that core still owns lifecycle, artifacts, and `/start-work` semantics.

## Primary assumptions handling

- Ask for missing assumptions before drafting.
- If assumptions are missing, prefer a concise clarification set instead of guessing.
- Prefer the skill-only extension path by default; only draft an agent prompt or plugin guidance when the author's need cannot be handled by a skill alone.
- Output is intentionally minimal; do not generate unnecessary pack scaffolding.

## Output rules

1. State the target domain and extension goal.
2. State target phase(s) and extension shape.
   - prefer `ramblings-<domain>-<phase-or-role>` for skill names
   - use kebab-case
   - keep names literal and narrow
   - avoid broad names like `manager`, `system`, or `framework`
3. Provide explicit boundary guidance:
   - specialized-first routing where the match is clear
   - core-fallback when extension signal is weak/missing
   - required handoff paths for generic behavior
4. Draft only the artifacts requested:
    - minimal `SKILL.md` section with name/description/tags/capability/usage guidance
    - optional single extension-agent draft when plugin-provided specialist capability is needed
    - optional short plugin-side notes for adding one specialist to existing `conductor` dispatch; do not design new runtime flow
5. End with a short verification checklist against the boundary.

## Tagging guidance

- When drafting plans or task examples, prefer the shared task-tag starter set first.
- Treat task-level `Tags` as the main runtime routing hints; do not assume skill-local tags are automatically consumed by OpenCode.
- Prefer starter tags such as:
  - **domain:** `coding`, `writing`, `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `docs`, `workflow`
  - **process:** `planning`, `implementation`, `refactor`, `migration`, `debug`, `qa`, `handoff`, `archive`
  - **risk / posture:** `high-risk`, `verification-heavy`, `bounded`, `multi-step`
- If a starter tag already fits, do not invent a synonym.

## Extension paths supported

- **Skill-only extension path:** the helper can draft skill artifacts without any plugin-level agent changes.
- **Plugin-agent extension path (optional):** when wider `conductor` specialist coverage is needed, include:
  - what specialist capability the plugin agent adds
  - what clear-match signals should trigger `conductor` preference
  - core fallback language when the plugin agent is absent
- Do not imply core runtime dependency on plugin agents.

## Required boundaries

- Keep `ramblings-core` ownership of lifecycle and lifecycle semantics unchanged.
- Do not define an extension registry, pack loader, dynamic runtime selector, or execution manager.
- Do not prescribe domain-specific runtime behavior; only draft the integration contract and prompts.

## Re-entry and completion signal

Completion is reached when the author has a minimal draft set matching their requested scope,
explicit routing/fallback language, and a clear boundary statement that core remains the runtime
owner.
